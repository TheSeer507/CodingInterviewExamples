# Coding Interview Examples

This repo contains some of the interview examples taken from different sources, is mainly for educational purposes to keep track
of the different questions some of the Tech companies do in their interview. I strongly encourage you, to further investigate and use other resources
such as Youtube for more indepth explanations and give your support to those who take their time to teach us. 

Is important to understand the context, as this foundation will make technical interviews much easier.

## Getting Started

Questions are divided into different folders that contains the question itself it a docx file format and the python solution
also the approach to this question on how to solve it is found within the folder. I am focusing on Python which is the language I am
more confortable and strong with. Feel free to contribute and add your own answers in different coding languages for others to benefit from
this repository.
