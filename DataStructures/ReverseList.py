#Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev, curr = None, head
        while curr:
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next
        return prev
